# Sembark's Terms of Service

Policies that apply to your account and use of this site

_<small>Last revised on September 01, 2020, effective as of September 01, 2021</small>_

These Terms of Service are a contract between you and Sembark Tech Private Limited (referred to in these Terms of Service as "Sembark", "us", "we" or "our"), the provider of the Sembark website and the services accessible from the Sembark website (which are collectively referred to in these Terms of Service as the "Sembark Service").

You are agreeing to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these Terms of Service, please do not use the Sembark Service. In these Terms of Service, "you" refers both to you as an individual and to the entity you represent. If you violate any of these Terms of Service, we reserve the right to cancel your account or block access to your account without notice.

## Account Terms

- **Eligibility.** Your account must be registered by a human. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. Additionally, you must be 16 years of age or older.

- **Registration Information.** You must provide your legal full name, a valid permanent email address, along with any other information required by Sembark during the registration process. One person or legal entity may not maintain more than one account.

- **Password.** You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. We will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation. Personally identifiable information submitted by you will be subject to our [Privacy Policy](/privacy).

- **Restrictions.** You may not use the Sembark Service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose. You must not, in the use of the Sembark Service, violate any laws in your jurisdiction, including, among other things, by:

  - distributing any virus, time bomb, trap door, or other harmful or disruptive computer code, mechanism or program;
  - covering or obscuring any notice, legend, warning or banner contained on the Sembark Service;
  - interfering with or circumventing any security feature of the Sembark Service or any feature that restricts or enforces limitations on use of or access to the Sembark Service;
  - infringing or violating the rights of any other party, including without limitation any intellectual property rights, including copyright laws, or rights of privacy or publicity;
  - being obscene, offensive, pornographic, fraudulent, deceptive, defamatory, threatening, harassing, abusive, slanderous, hateful, or causing embarrassment to any other person as determined by Sembark in its sole discretion; or
  - deliberately misleading anyone as to your identity, impersonating another, or falsely identifying the source of any information.

## Payment, Refunds, Upgrading and Downgrading Terms

A valid payment method, such as a credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide the Company with accurate and complete billing information including full name, company name, address, state, zip code, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize the Company to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments. Free accounts are not required to provide a credit card number.

The Sembark Service is billed in advance in accordance with our pricing schedule. You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you choose when purchasing a Subscription. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, annual payments, or refunds for months unused with an open account, except in the case of our 30-day money back guarantee (see below). In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or the Company cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal through our website or by contacting Sembark customer support [support@sembark.com](support@sembark.com).

All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and you will be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties, excluding only United States (federal or state) income taxes. You agree to pay for any taxes that might be applicable to your use of the Sembark Service or payments made by you in connection with your use of the Sembark Service.

### 30-day money back guarantee

If for any reason, you are unhappy with your Sembark purchase, we do offer a 30-day money back guarantee. If you decide not to use Sembark in your business within 30 days from your **first payment**, you may request a full refund. This applies to both annual and monthly subscriptions.

## Modifications to the Sembark Site and Prices

We reserve the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Sembark Service (or any part thereof) with or without notice. However, we will make our very best efforts to notify customers of any upcoming system maintenance and/or service disruptions.

Prices of all Sembark Service plans are subject to change. If Sembark does for any reason have to remove the plan you are on or require an upgrade to a current plan, we will provide you with at least six (6) months notice via email.

We will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Sembark Service.

We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change, modify, add to, supplement or delete any portion of these Terms of Service at any time, effective with or without prior notice; provided, however, that we will use reasonable efforts to provide you with notification of any material changes (as determined in our sole discretion) by email.

If any future changes to these Terms of Service are unacceptable to you or cause you to no longer be in compliance, you must immediately stop using the Sembark Service. Your continued use of the Sembark Service following any revision to this Agreement constitutes your complete acceptance of any and all such changes. Any new features that augment or enhance the current Sembark Service, including the release of new tools and resources, will be subject to these Terms of Service.
