        Ensuring timely payments from customers is a real challenge for a Travel
        business. Not getting timely payments from customers can choke off cash
        flow and can be really frustrating for any business. According to
        surveys, 40% payments do not get paid on time from customers.
      </p>
      <p>Not getting payments on time can happen if</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Customers forgot to make payment on scheduled time</li>
        <li>You did not send the reminder on time</li>
        <li>
          You are hesitating to ask for payment out of fear of being greedy and
          unprofessional
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        With these in mind, let’s see how Sembark Travel software helps you in
        improving the success rate of on-time payments and what you could have
        done with your money by improving this process.
      </p>
      <h2>Clearly state your payment terms in writing</h2>
      <p>
        Verbal agreement with clients might be of worth but nothing beats the
        agreement when done properly in writing or documented. Do not hesitate
        to write down clear

          target="_blank"
          >payment terms</a
        >
        which have every tiny detail to cover every possible scenario.
      </p>
      <p>
        Payment terms and policies should be defined in a clear way so that
        customers don’t get confused about the terms or, if you are using a
        specific <a href="https://sembark.com">travel software</a>, you can do
        this by including the payment terms at the end of itinerary, invoice or
        other documents created by the software.
      </p>
      <h2>Assessing due payment of customers</h2>
      <p>
        DMC or Travel company is converting no. of queries (for Trip, Hotel,
        Cabs) from B2B and B2C customers on a daily basis. These converted
        queries or bookings require lots of reservations to confirm and invoices
        to raise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every booking might have different payment terms and policies agreed
        with the customer. Higher the volume of bookings means more numbers of
        payments has to be made by customers which require more time to track
        all the payments. If you are using Excel spreadsheets or CRM systems to
        keep track of all the payments, this will be more time consuming due to
        several manual steps involved in the process. Firstly, someone would
        have to manually check all the bookings to find out bookings which have
        due payments or overdue payments. Then, They would manually send the
        payment reminders to customers to get paid.
